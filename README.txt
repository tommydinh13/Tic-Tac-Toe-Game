Just a simple 2-player tic tac toe game made to practice my C++ skills.
Future plans for ttt:
1) Turn basic tic tac toe game to ultimate tic tac toe
2) Have the game keep score of multiple rounds 

TO RUN:
1) Enter directory that contains ttt.cpp
2) Compile by running "g++ -o ttt ttt.cpp"
3) Run by entering "./ttt"
